# IK_Robot
A Unity Inverse Kinematics demo, consiting of a 4 limbed robot that can move left and right.
Each limb has 3 degrees of freedom and is procedurally animated to match the ground height. The robot can thus appear to navigate uneven terrain.

This is a simple demo project to explore the basics of IK and procedural animation.
